Another long day at school.

Another day of lessons, homework, assignments, worksheets flies by.

Mrs Thiru is still concerned about you, even though she seems to have forgotten what you’d said to her yesterday.

With your class of 40 students occupying all of her time, can you really blame her?

Thiru: “How’s your preparation for the test?” (emotionThiru: concerned)

<<if mom_standyourground is 1>> 

    MC: “I… didn’t really prepare.”

    Mrs Thiru is taken aback. (emotionThiru: surprised)

    You cannot meet her glance.

    Thiru: “Is everything okay at home?”

    You want to tell her about that argument you and mom had.

    But yet, there’s still that level of doubt and distrust…

    What will she say? Can anything she say help?

    MC: “Yeah, everything is fine.”

    Mrs Thiru: “Then please study for the test tomorrow. It’s not too late - you have one more day to prepare.” (emotionThiru: disappointed)

    As you walk out of her office, you can’t help but feel like you disappointed Mrs Thiru.

    Still, you know yourself best, right?

    MC: “Well, it’s… I’m trying my best. I made a deal with my mum.”

    MC: “if I do well, she won’t force me to attend new tuition classes.”

    You catch a glimmer of amusement in Mrs Thiru’s eye. (emotionThiru: amused)

    Mrs Thiru: “That’s some good motivation… I’m glad you’ve decided to take charge of your own learning. But if you really do need some help preparing, do reach out to me.” 

    Mrs Thiru smiles kindly at you. Her wording makes you feel somewhat better than anything your parents have told you.

    You leave her office, cautiously optimistic.

    MC: “I’m going to meet with my tutor today.”

    Mrs Thiru: “Oh? You engaged a private tutor?” (emotionThiru: surprised)

    It’s too late for Mrs Thiru to hide the tone of discontent in her voice.

    Mrs Thiru: “Well that’s good, at least you’re getting a little extra help.”

    Mrs Thiru: “As a teacher, I’ve always thought private tuition to be extra, but every student is different and learns at a different pace.”

    Mrs Thiru: “Hope you’ll grasp the learning material well for the test tomorrow.”

    You leave her office, optimistic about your chances, yet still wondering how much the private tutor can help.
