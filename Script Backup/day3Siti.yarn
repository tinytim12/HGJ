    << if $droptuition_siti is 1>> 

        As one of the top students in your class, you’d expect that Siti wouldn’t be too concerned about the test.

        Yet, she still frowns as you sit next to her for lunch. <<SitiAnnoyed GameController>>

        MC: “What’s wrong, Siti?”

        Siti: “My parents signed me up for English tuition...”

        MC: “But… you topped the school cohort for English!” 

        Siti: “It doesn’t matter to them. Now, my only free afternoon - Tuesday - is gone. They didn’t even bother asking me about it.”

    << if if continuetuition_siti is 1>> 

        Siti looks more relaxed today.

        You’re not seeing the same enthusiastic girl who encouraged you to join her new CCA.

        As you sit next to her, she smiles weakly at you.

        Siti: “I did it… I told my parents I didn’t need an English tutor.”

        Siti: “They didn’t handle it so well at first, but I made enough noise that they eventually listened.”

        Siti: “If my parents could be swayed, then perhaps there’s hope for others too.”

        Siti: “Do you think it’s possible that one day, we’ll be rid of this whole tuition business?”

MC: “...”
MC: “I know you’re strong, Siti. Perhaps treat it as extra practice?”
Siti sighs. <<SitiWorried GameController>>
Siti: “I guess… but I would rather spend that time on my CCA. I wonder how much more of this I can tahan.”
You fall silent.
This doesn’t sound like the Siti you met on Monday.
She had sounded hopeful.

MC: “I guess talking to your parents is not an option.”
Siti laughs, but her chortle is void of humor.
Siti: “If only it was that easy…”
Siti: “I wish there was someone else to talk to, someone who can actually help.”
MC: “Have you tried talking to the school counsellor?”
Siti: “But… only kids who actually need help go to her, right?”
MC: “Everyone can get by a little better with some help. Perhaps you should give it a try, treat her as a friend.”
Siti hesitates a little. <<SitiWorried GameController>>
MC: “She’s paid to listen to your problems anyway.” 
Siti chuckles a little. <<SitiAmused GameController>>

MC: “and took charge of their own studies.”
Siti: “… but is hard work alone enough?”
Siti: “Some people still struggle no matter the amount of effort they put in.” <<SitiWorried GameController>>
MC: “... the system isn’t entirely meritocratic, not so much like in the past.”
Siti: “Now every parent who can afford an advantage for his or her kid would gladly do so. The kid who has a less fortunate parent… loses out.”
You’re reminded of your own struggle against your parents.
Siti might come from a more prosperous family than you, but in the long run…
Are the two of you so different? 
And, what about kids who were not dealt such a good hand in life?
MC: “Yeah… kids who need to work for their family, or those trapped in an abusive family drama - they won’t stand a chance too.”
Siti: “My problems seem small compared to theirs. I hope someone changes the system in future...” <<SitiHopeful GameController>>
You resist scoffing at that.
If we can’t even influence our own parents...
MC: “They are still very much valid. I’m glad you freed up some time for yourself Siti. You deserve some rest too.”
As Siti leaves the canteen, you realise that in 3 short days you learned so much about her.
So much more than when she was in class.
She wasn’t just at the top of the mountain.
She was struggling to breathe on top, too.

MC: “Academic pathways are still, for the most part, prided as guarantees to job security and success, as compared to alternative ones. As long as that mentality exists, I doubt we can bid goodbye to that business.” 
Siti: “But it’s better now than in the past right? We can choose to pursue a practical diploma in a polytechnic or continue on the academic pathway in junior college.”
MC: “Technically, those options are available. But, mentally, people are still closed off towards their kids choosing that route.”
Siti: “But…”
Siti falls silent. <<SitiWorried GameController>>
She couldn’t understand, could she?
But who could blame her? You, whose parents insist on getting tuition for you?
How are we to filter out an issue that runs in our blood?

You’re home again. Opening your WhatsApp chat, you’re greeted by a question from your mom.

“How was the test today?”

So deceptively simple, yet worrying, at the same time.
