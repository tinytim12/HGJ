Crashing down on the couch in your living room, you check your family WhatsApp chat.

Surprisingly, it is quiet, with only the remnants of your mom’s scolding from yesterday on it.

But you get a new message:

Dad: “Hey kid. Sorry about what happened yesterday…”

Dad: “Mom and I have been really busy with work…”

<<if $mom_standyourground is 1>> 

    Dad: “I know mom can be a little forceful.” 

    Dad: “But she cares for you. You’ve got to understand where she comes from. She is working hard to give you everything you have now.”

    [[ I thought about it yesterday. | thoughtyest ]] ]]
    [[ She does not understand where I come from… | nounderstand ]] ]]

<<endif>> 

<< if $mom_negotiate is 1>> 

    Dad: “I heard you have a test tomorrow...are you ready?”

    [[ I hope I can do well. | ihope ]]
    [[ Not really... | notreally ]] ]]

<<endif>>

<< if $mom_submit is 1>> 

    Dad: “just wanted to ask if tuition went well today… there’s gonna be more work for you.”

    [[ Thanks dad. | thanksdad ]]
    [[ Sighs | Sighs ]]

MC: “I will apologise to mom.”
MC: “But I still hope she understands where I come from.”
Dad: “I know... That hopelessness, hatred.... Well, use it as fuel to study.”
Dad: “The sooner you graduate, the sooner you get a job, the more independent you’ll be.”
Dad: “Okay kid, gotta bounce. See you soon”
And now, time to spend 10 minutes crafting a message for your mom.
Will she even see it? And how will she respond when she does?
Internally, you cringe a bit as you type a generic apology. But it fits your purposes well.

MC: “Does she even listen to what I have to say? Every time she talks, it’s about her hopes, her dreams. Nothing about me and how I feel about this.”
Dad: “You have to try and understand. She was being angry. She didn’t know what she was saying. If you offer peace first, she’ll take it.”
MC: “So I have to apologise for what she says when she’s angry?”

MC: "I really tried this time.”
Dad: “That’s good :)”
Dad: “Go sleep early. All the best!”
You smile a little as you lock your phone.
Yet, you wonder why dad didn’t show you support like this yesterday.
Or 3 months ago when your last exam got you ripped apart by mom.
Was he really too busy for you?

MC: “The more I study, the more confused I get… :(”
Dad: “ :( ”
Dad: “I know you always try to do your best. Dad is still proud of you no matter what okay?”
You smile a little as you lock your phone.

MC: “I’ll be fine.”
MC: “Hopefully I can get better grades and not disappoint mom again...”
Dad: “that’s good, that’s good.”
Dad: “All the best kiddo! Do us proud :)”
You lock your phone.
Closing your eyes, you summon your mental strength to keep going.

MC: “But what can I do?”
MC: “I’m trying really hard to like it, but I don’t. It’s in the way of things I really want to do.”
Dad: “I really want to take a break, but I can’t because I have to earn money for the family. You have to learn that in life, we often don’t get to do the things we like.”
Dad: “If you had listened to your mom, perhaps you’ll have understood this already. She knows what’s best for you.”
You don’t even wanna continue this.
You lock your phone, and throw it aside.
Why can’t your parents ever see how tough it is to be a student?
Did they forget?
