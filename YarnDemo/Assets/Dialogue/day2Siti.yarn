You walk down to the canteen and settle next to your friend for a meal.

<<if $approach_siti is 1>> 

Siti barely has time to eat her food.

Putting aside her utensils every few seconds, she responds to a text on her phone. You recognise it as one of the higher end models.

MC: “So, this new CCA… seems like it’s quite busy, isn’t it?”

Siti: “I wish these texts were from the CCA... It’s this private tutor. He won’t stop messaging me past year papers and practice questions!“ <<SitiAnnoyed GameController>>

Siti: “I just feel so overwhelmed with everything you know, balancing CCAs, volunteering, leadership activities and school work... I just want to drop this tuition.”

Finally, a kindred (sort of) spirit. What will you advise her to do?

[[ But the test is tomorrow. | nodrop ]]
[[ Perhaps you should. | drop ]]

MC: “how about dropping it after?” 
Siti: “Yeah, but I feel quite well-prepared for it already…”
Siti: “Well, I guess I can’t take this risk. It’s better to be safe than sorry right?”
You nod. You don’t necessarily agree that tuition is the best way, but the alternatives didn’t seem too appealing.

MC: “It’ll give you some room to breathe.”
Siti: “Wait, really?” <<SitiHopeful GameController>>
MC: “It’s stressing you out, isn’t it?”
MC: “Besides, if there’s one person in this class who is ready for the test, it’s definitely you.”
Siti: “I guess you’re right. I do feel quite well-prepared for the test.”
Siti: “If there’s one opportunity for me to voice my thoughts to my parents, it’s now.”
Siti: “They really do believe that tuition equals better grades, which equal better job opportunities… I get it, but it gets stale, you know?”
Siti: “Shouldn’t there be more to learning than just tuition classes?”
You nod, concurring with the grandiose notion of a fun way to learn without the pressure of having to take an excessive amount of tuition classes...
