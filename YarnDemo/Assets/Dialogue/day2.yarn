Another long day at school.

Another day of lessons, homework, assignments, worksheets flies by.

Mrs Thiru is still concerned about you, even though she seems to have forgotten what you’d said to her yesterday.

With your class of 40 students occupying all of her time, can you really blame her?

<<changeScene GameController staffroom>>

<<startFadeIn GameController 1 bg>>

Thiru: “How’s your preparation for the test?” 

<<ThiruConcerned Sprite>>

<<startFadeIn GameController 1 s>>

<<wait 1>>


<<if $mom_standyourground is 1>> 

    MC: “I… didn’t really prepare.”

    Mrs Thiru is taken aback. 
    
    <<ThiruSurprised Sprite>>

    You cannot meet her glance.

    Thiru: “Is everything okay at home?”

    You want to tell her about that argument you and mom had.

    But yet, there’s still that level of doubt and distrust…

    What will she say? Can anything she say help?

    MC: “Yeah, everything is fine.”

    Mrs Thiru: “Then please study for the test tomorrow. It’s not too late - you have one more day to prepare.” 
    
    <<ThiruDisappointed Sprite>>

    As you walk out of her office, you can’t help but feel like you'd disappointed Mrs Thiru.

<< if $mom_negotiate is 1>> 

    MC: “Well, it’s… I’m trying my best. I made a deal with my mum.”

    MC: “If I do well, she won’t force me to attend new tuition classes.”

    You catch a glimmer of amusement in Mrs Thiru’s eye. 
    
    <<ThiruAmused Sprite>>

    Mrs Thiru: “That’s some good motivation… I’m glad you’ve decided to take charge of your own learning. But if you really do need some help preparing, do reach out to me.” 

    Mrs Thiru smiles kindly at you. Her wording makes you feel somewhat better than anything your parents have told you.

    You leave her office, cautiously optimistic.

<< if $mom_submit is 1>> 

    MC: “I’m going to meet with my tutor today.”

    Mrs Thiru: “Oh? You engaged a private tutor?” 
    
    <<ThiruSurprised Sprite>>

    It’s too late for Mrs Thiru to hide a mixed tone of discontent and amusement in her voice.

    Mrs Thiru: “Well that’s good, at least you’re getting a little extra help.”

    Mrs Thiru: “As a teacher, I’ve always thought private tuition to be extra, but every student is different and learns at a different pace.”

    Mrs Thiru: “I hope you’ll be able to grasp the learning material well for the test tomorrow.” 
    
    << ThiruAmused Sprite >>

    You leave her office, optimistic about your chances, yet still wondering how much the private tutor can help.

You walk down to the canteen and settle next to your friend for a meal.

<<if $approach_james is 1>> 

James looks stressed. The weight of all his concerns sinks his shoulders and glance, as he picks at his food.

<<JamesTired Sprite>>
<<startFadeIn GameController 1 s>>
<<wait 1>>

MC: “Hey, is everything alright?”

James: “Yeah, it’s just… my dad injured himself."

James: "My family needs the money so I have to do another shift at his workplace tonight.” 

James: “I wish I could be like Siti - pursuing things I like and doing them well."

<<startFadeIn GameController 1 s>>
<<wait 1>>

Siti barely has time to eat her food.

Putting aside her utensils every few seconds, she responds to a text on her phone. You recognise it as one of the higher end models.

MC: “Your new CCA working you really hard?"

Siti: “I wish these texts were from my CCA... It’s this private tutor. He won’t stop messaging me about the past year papers and practice questions that I have to do when I get back home!“ 

Siti: “I just feel so overwhelmed with everything - balancing CCAs, volunteering, engaging in leadership activities and school work... I wish I could drop this tutor.”

[[ But the test is tomorrow. | SitiDay1.1 ]]

Siti: “Well, I guess I shouldn’t risk it. It’s better to be safe than sorry right?”
You nod. You don’t necessarily agree that tuition is the best way, but the alternatives didn’t seem too appealing.

MC: “It’s stressing you out, isn’t it?”
MC: “Besides, if there’s one person in this class who is ready for the test, it’s definitely you.”
Siti: “I guess you’re right. I do feel quite prepared for the test.”
Siti: “If there’s one opportunity for me to voice my thoughts to my parents, it’s now.”
Siti: “They really do believe that tuition equals better grades, which equal better job opportunities… I get it, but it gets stale, you know?”
Siti: “Shouldn’t there be more to learning than just tuition classes?”
You nod, concurring with the grandiose notion of a fun way to learn without the pressure of having to take an excessive amount of tuition classes...

James sighs and shakes his head. 
<<JamesFrustrated Sprite>>
James: “It’s easy for you to say. My dad does not earn enough to cover basic expenses… It’s not a choice, like how you see it.”
MC: “That is not what I meant - ”
James: “I don’t see any way to escape this... Why does my life have to be much harder than others?”
James: “Look at Siti over there. She does well on all her tests, is popular among classmates, holds many student leadership positions...” 
James: “Why can't my life be more like hers?"
You don’t have an answer.
MC: “Whatever you choose, I’ll be here for you.”

Crashing down on the couch in your living room, you check your family WhatsApp chat.

Surprisingly, it is quiet, with only the remnants of your mom’s scolding from yesterday on it.

<<PhoneDull Sprite>>

You get a new message:

Dad: “Hey kid. Sorry about what happened yesterday…”

Dad: “Mom and I have been really busy with work…”

<<if $mom_standyourground is 1>> 

    Dad: “I know mom can be a little forceful.” 

    Dad: “But she cares for you. You’ve got to understand where she comes from. She is working hard to give you everything you have now.”

    [[ I thought about it yesterday. | DadDay2.1 ]] ]]
    [[ She does not understand where I come from… | DadDay2.2 ]] ]]

MC: “I will apologise to mom.”
MC: “But I still hope she understands where I come from.”
Dad: “I do... That feeling of being forced on a path you see no end to... Use it as fuel to study.”
Dad: “The sooner you graduate, the sooner you can get a job and the more independent you can be.”
Dad: “Okay kid, gotta bounce. See you soon.”
And now, time to spend 10 minutes crafting a message for your mom.
Will she even see it? And how will she respond when she does?
Internally, you cringe a little as you type a generic apology. 
In the end, you decide that you’ll allocate the usual amount of time to your homework at night. (You have 30 seconds for a homework exercise later.)

MC: “Does she even listen to what I have to say? Every time she talks, it’s about her hopes, her dreams. Nothing about me and how I feel about this.”
Dad: “You have to try and understand. She was very tired from her own work yesterday. If you offer peace first, she’ll take it.”
MC: “So I have to apologise for how she communicates with me when she's angry?”
Your exchange with dad drained you emotionally. You doubt that you’ll have the energy to complete your homework when you inevitably have to do it. (You have 15 seconds for the homework exercise later.)

Yet, you wonder why dad didn’t show you support like this yesterday.
Or 3 months ago when your last exam got you ripped apart by mom.

Dad: “I really want to take a break, but I can’t because I have to earn money for the family. You have to learn that in life, we often don’t get to do the things we like.”
Dad: “If you had listened to your mom, perhaps you’ll have understood this already. She knows what’s best for you.”
You don’t even want to continue this exchange with dad.

<<PhoneTense Sprite>>
You lock your phone, and throw it aside.
Why can’t your parents ever see how tough it is to be a student?
Did they forget?
